# Elevator_project
It's a simple console app which represents elevator.

First you have to enter number of floors in your house.

Next is you have to choose which floor are you at now.

Then program randomly tell where the elevator is now and showing where it is going (up or down).

The next thing is that you are telling where you need to go.

Enjoy :)
